## Challenges
Natually, several challenges arose when writing this page using modern web development methods, the primary of which was flexbox. Flexbox can be a frustrating tool to work with at first, especially when playing with all the possible values at once. The way that I was able to get past the confusion about the process was to strip back all options and work with each value, one at a time.
